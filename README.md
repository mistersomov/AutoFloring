# Auto-Irrigation System for ESP32 ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§
This project is an automated irrigation system powered by an ESP32 
microcontroller. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and water levels, controls a pump for irrigation, and logs information on an LCD display. The system ensures efficient water usage while minimizing human intervention.

## Features
- **Soil & Water Monitoring**: Reads data from moisture and water level sensors.
- **Automated Irrigation**: Activates the pump when moisture levels drop below a threshold.
- **LCD Display**: Displays real-time sensor readings and warnings.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Uses NTP for time synchronization and potential remote monitoring.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Enters deep sleep mode between irrigation cycles.
- **Error Handling**: Provides warnings for low water levels and device initialization failures.
